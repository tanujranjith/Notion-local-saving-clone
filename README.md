NoteFlow - A Local-First, Private Alternative to Notion
Your notes, your data, your machine. All in a single HTML file.

NoteFlow is a powerful, self-contained note-taking application that runs entirely in your browser. It's designed for users who value privacy, data ownership, and simplicity. Unlike cloud-based services like Notion, NoteFlow is local-first, meaning your entire workspace lives on your device. No accounts, no servers, no subscriptions.

Why NoteFlow? The Local-First Advantage
In an era of cloud lock-in and privacy concerns, NoteFlow puts you back in control.

‚úÖ Truly Private: Cloud services can access your notes. NoteFlow stores everything in your browser's local storage. Your data never leaves your machine unless you explicitly export or back it up.

‚úÖ No Lock-In: Your entire workspace can be exported as a single, human-readable .json file. This makes backups, migration, and sharing effortless.

‚úÖ Offline & Always Available: Since it's a local file, your workspace is always accessible, even without an internet connection. No more downtime or server dependence.

‚úÖ Full Ownership: Your pages, themes, and data are yours. Period.

‚ú® Features
üìù Rich Text Editor: Format your notes with headers, bold, italics, lists, blockquotes, code blocks, and more.

üóÇÔ∏è Hierarchical Pages: Organize your notes with infinite nesting. Simply use :: in your page titles (e.g., Projects::Website Redesign::Tasks) to create a beautifully structured and indented sidebar.

üé® Advanced Theming Engine:

Apply themes to a single page, all pages, or a custom selection of pages.

Choose from 6 beautiful preset themes (including Dark, Sepia, and Forest).

Create your own themes with a custom color picker for backgrounds, text, and accents.

üíæ Robust Data Management:

Auto-Save: Changes are saved automatically to your browser's local storage.

Export/Import: Download your entire workspace to a single .json file for easy backups or sharing.

Optional Google Drive Backup: Securely back up your workspace to your own Google Drive account.

‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts: Boost your productivity with shortcuts for saving, creating new pages, and toggling the theme panel.

üöÄ Zero Installation: It's just one HTML file. No dependencies, no build steps, no servers to manage.

üìö Built-in Help: A "Help & Docs" page is automatically created to get you started with all the key features.

üöÄ Getting Started
Download: Get the GPT o3 improving on Grok 4.html file.

Rename (Optional): Rename it to noteflow.html or index.html for convenience.

Open: Open the file in a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

That's it! You can start creating notes immediately. Your work will be saved automatically in the browser you are using.

üíæ Saving & Data Portability
Local Storage: Your primary workspace is saved in your browser's localStorage. This is fast and works offline but is tied to that specific browser and device.

Export (Recommended for Backups): Use the Export button to save a complete noteflow_export.json file. This is the best way to create backups, move your workspace between devices, or share it with others.

Import: Use the Import button to load a .json file and instantly restore a workspace.

‚òÅÔ∏è Setting up Google Drive Backup (Optional)
For added peace of mind, you can enable backups to your own Google Drive. This requires setting up free Google Cloud credentials.

Open the HTML file in a text editor.

Go to the Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials.

Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID for a Web application. You will need to configure the authorized origins to include the URL where you are hosting the file (or null for local files).

Create an API Key.

Find the following lines in the <script> section of the HTML file:

JavaScript

// Google Drive API Configuration
const CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'; // Replace with your Google Client ID
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace with your Google API Key
Replace the placeholder values with your actual Client ID and API Key.

Uncomment the line // initGoogleDrive(); at the bottom of the script to enable the feature:

JavaScript

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    initApp();
    // Uncomment the next line when you have Google API credentials
    initGoogleDrive(); // <-- Like this
});
Save the file. The "Save to Drive" button will now be fully functional.

üîê Privacy by Design
No trackers.

No background syncing (unless you enable and use the Google Drive feature).

No corporate lock-in.

Your notes = your ownership.
