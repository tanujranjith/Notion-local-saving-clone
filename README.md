NoteFlow – Local-First Notion Alternative

🚨 Why Notion Isn’t Private

❌ No End-to-End Encryption – your notes are stored on Notion’s servers.

❌ Cloud Lock-In – exporting and migrating is limited and clunky.

❌ Server Dependence – outages mean you lose access to your workspace.

✅ Why Choose NoteFlow

Local-First → Everything is saved on your device by default.

No Need for E2E Encryption → Your notes never leave your machine unless you decide.

One-File Sharing → Your entire workspace is a single JSON file — easy to back up, move, or share.

Full Control → Pages, themes, and data stay yours. No subscriptions, no hidden servers.

💾 Saving & Sharing

Save Locally → Browser or device storage.

Export → Download one JSON file with all your progress.

Import → Restore instantly or share with others.

Optional Cloud Backup → Save to Google Drive if you want convenience.

🔐 Privacy by Design

No trackers.

No background syncing.
